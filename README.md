IguanaTex is a PowerPoint add-in which allows you to insert LaTeX equations into your PowerPoint presentation. It is distributed completely for free, along with its source code.

This repository hosts the source code in a form that can be easily tracked, shared and discussed.

For those interested in using IguanaTex, please download the add-in as a .ppam or .pptm file from http://www.jonathanleroux.org/software/iguanatex/.
